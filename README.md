Lets practice some

#### **_RECURSION IN PYTHON_**

Don't worry if it isn't immediately clear how to solve them, work through different ideas and write some code! It's okay to work through a 'naive' solve first and then move on to applying a hash table to optimize your solution.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repo, and cd into python-recursion-challenges
* each challenge is in a `.py` file so you can work on them one at time and use the command `python <filename>.py` to check your work
* the challenges are ranked from least to most challenging, so start with number one

## Tips and Tricks

When first considering how to write a recursive function first consider:
  * What is the base case, that is _what is the condition that stop to recursion_
  * What is the recursive logic, _ie what is the chunk of code that needs to run each time the function recurses_
